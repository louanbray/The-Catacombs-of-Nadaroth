{Bomb}
"A compact but deadly device, crudely constructed yet undeniably effective.~
Its surface is etched with warnings in an ancient script, though the meaning is clear enough: destruction."~
~
 -> Detonates the (nearest [WIP] -> upper) room, clearing all entities and resetting the area.~
 -> Warning: No loot will be gained from the explosion.~
    The room will regenerate upon return, either with a new layout or the same as before (if fate plays its tricks).~
 -> "The fuse burns with an eerie hiss, and as the explosion reverberates,~
     the catacombs seem to shift and groan in protest."~
