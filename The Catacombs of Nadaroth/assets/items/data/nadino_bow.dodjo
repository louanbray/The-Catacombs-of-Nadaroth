{Nadino Bow}
"A relic of the lost Nadino civilization, this bow is a work of art as much as a weapon.~
Its body glows faintly with an ancient aura, and its string appears to be spun from starlight."~
~
 -> The ultimate bow, capable of immense destruction, imbued with mystical properties (42 hearts of damage / long lasting arrows).~
 -> "Legends whisper that a single arrow loosed from the Nadino Bow could shatter mountains and part the seas."~
