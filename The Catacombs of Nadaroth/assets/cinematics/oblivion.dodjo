#
%The darkness presses against you, cold and unyielding.~
#

%You awaken on the damp stone floor, your mind a foggy maze of scattered fragments.~
#


%Your name, your purpose—lost to the void.~
#



%The only certainty is the weight of the catacombs above and the unsettling quiet around you.~
#




%This is Nadaroth, a land shrouded in whispered legends of the forgotten and the forsaken.~
#





%They say these twisting tunnels are alive, reshaping themselves, guarding secrets no mortal eyes were meant to see.~
#






%Somewhere deep within lies the answer to your plight—or your undoing.~
#







%Before you, faint glyphs pulse on an ancient portal, their meaning elusive yet tantalizing.~
#








%Behind you, the silence grows heavier, as though the shadows themselves are watching.~
#









%Your journey begins here, adventurer.~
#










%Will you reclaim your identity and escape this labyrinth of despair?~
#











%Or will the catacombs consume you, as they have so many before?~
#












%The choice is yours, but beware: in Nadaroth, even the walls have ears,~
#













%and the darkness hides truths that would drive you mad.~
