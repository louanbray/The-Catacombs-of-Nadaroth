%<The First Awakening>~
#


%When death claims you for the first time, you awaken battered and bewildered in the spawn room.~
#



%The cold stone floor greets you as you struggle to piece together your shattered memories.~
#




%In this initial haze, you question the very nature of your existence-are these fragmented~
#





%recollections the shreds of a life once lived, or mere illusions borne from trauma?~
#






%Subtle echoes of distant voices and the gentle pulse of ancient glyphs hint at a deeper tale,~
#







%though you cannot yet trust your mind entirely.~
#









%"Who am I?" you murmur to the silent darkness, not yet aware of the journey ahead-~
#










%a journey where every loss brings a chance to remember.~
