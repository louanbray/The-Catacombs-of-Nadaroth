%<The Unyielding Bond>~

%Now, with your score well-earned and each death etching deeper marks upon your mind,~
#



%the revelations become more potent.~
#




%You start to perceive that the catacombs themselves are intertwined with your destiny.~
#





%Whispers in the dark begin to form a chorus—a resounding truth about the creator of this labyrinth.~
#






%In this stage, you confront the possibility that you are not a mere victim of fate,~
#







%but an integral fragment of something far greater.~
#









%The echoes reveal that the creator once rebelled against the cosmic order,~
#










%and fragments of that defiance seep into your very soul.~
#











%You gather the fragments of your past like pieces of a puzzle, and a morbid certainty begins to emerge:~
#












%your journey here might be less about escape and more about embracing an ancient, forgotten lineage.~
