%<The Dark Inheritance>~
#


%The full burden of truth crashes upon you.~
#



%As you stand once more on the cold floor of your spawn room,~
#




%your once-fragmented recollections converge into a single, devastating realization:~
#





%you are part of the soul of the very creator of these catacombs-a being who once rebelled,~
#






%whose rebellion birthed this maze of despair.~
#







%You were cast into this realm not merely to die repeatedly,~
#








%but to serve as the vessel for a tortured echo of rebellion and entertainment for a long-dead master.~
#










%Rage and sorrow intermingle as you confront your grim destiny.~
#











%With each death and each regained memory,~
#












%you find yourself teetering on the edge of collapse or transformation.~
#














%The revelation is as liberating as it is damning:~
#















%In your veins flows the essence of defiance,~
#
















%an inheritance that might one day allow you to shatter these chains-or doom you further to despair.~
