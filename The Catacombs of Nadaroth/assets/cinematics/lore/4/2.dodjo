%<Echoes of the Past>~
#


%As you accumulate victories and your score climbs before the inevitable next death,~
#



%fragments of your previous adventures begin to surface.~
#




%You recall fleeting images: corridors lined with enigmatic inscriptions,~
#





%mysterious threats that once loomed large, and the faint glimmer of hope in moments of triumph.~
#






%Your mind clings to these hints, forming a tenuous connection to something lost.~
#








%Each death now leaves you with a burning question:~
#









%What drove you to these perilous catacombs?~
#











%The world seems to whisper that every room you traverse, every enemy you vanquish,~
#












%is a step toward reclaiming who you once were.~
