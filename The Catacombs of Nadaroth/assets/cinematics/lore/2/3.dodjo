%<Frayed Reflections>~
#


%With each death, the few coherent memories that once sparked hints of a past existence grow fainter.~
#



%The echoes of once-proud defiance and a rebellious legacy are now mere murmurings,~
#




%drowned out by the dissonance of a mind unraveling.~
#





%A name, a purpose, even the very reason for your presence-~
#






%everything you once held dear seems to be slipping away like sand through desperate fingers.~
#








%Your recollections blur into dreams that fragment further with every reawakening,~
#









%leaving you grasping at shadows that offer no solace.~
