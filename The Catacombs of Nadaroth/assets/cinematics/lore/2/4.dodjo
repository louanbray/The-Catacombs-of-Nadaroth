%<The Abyss of Lost Thought>~
#


%As your score rises and the toll of repeated deaths compounds,~
#



%the labyrinth reveals nothing more than a vast emptiness.~
#




%The once-promising whisper of an ancient rebellion dissolves into incoherent murmurs.~
#





%The mosaic of your identity shatters into inconsequential shards;~
#






%even if you try to piece them together, the image remains indecipherable.~
#








%The cold realization settles: the deeper you delve into the maze, the more your reason unravels.~
#









%The memory of defiance, of lineage, of purpose is eroding—~
#










%leaving you stranded in a perpetual state of internal dissonance and mounting despair.~
