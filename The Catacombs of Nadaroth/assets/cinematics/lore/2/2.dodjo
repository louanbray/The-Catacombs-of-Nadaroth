%<Fading Echoes>~
#


%In your subsequent journey through the labyrinth, remnants of your former self emerge in disjointed flashes.~
#



%The corridors blur into a feverish tapestry of half-remembered battles, faces,~
#




%and fractured symbols that hold no clear meaning.~
#





%Every enemy slain or obstacle overcome leaves behind not clarity, but a deeper chasm of confusion.~
#







%Your mind struggles to grasp at these fleeting images,~
#








%yet their significance dissolves into the surrounding darkness—~
#









%each moment a murky imprint that fails to connect with the next.~
