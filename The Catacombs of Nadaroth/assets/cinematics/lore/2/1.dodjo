%<The Shattered Awakening>~
#


%You awaken in the spawn room once more, but this time the stone beneath you feels colder,~
#



%as if indifferent to your pain.~
#




%Your vision is dim, and even the once-familiar darkness now seems to press in with a crushing weight.~
#





%Questions stir at the edges of your mind—faint, elusive—but they slip away almost as quickly as they appear.~
#







%"Who am I?" becomes a whisper lost in the void, a query without answer, as you rise with a heavy heart.~
