%<The Hollow Awakening>~
#


%You stir in the spawn chamber, but this awakening is stripped of any warmth.~
#



%The darkness seems to swallow even your breath,~
#




%leaving behind a numb void where questions once resounded.~
#





%Your eyes flicker with a vacant emptiness as you drag yourself upright, a shadow of who you might have been.~
#







%"Who… who am I?" The thought is there, an echo barely registering, as you succumb to a near-blank existence.~
