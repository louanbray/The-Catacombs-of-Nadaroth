%<The Final Unraveling>~
#


%Now, you stand at the precipice of complete annihilation of self.~
#



%The labyrinth, with all its secrets and whispered lore,~
#




%has lost its power to stir even the faintest glimmer of your former defiance.~
#





%There is no revelation, no sliver of identity to grasp.~
#







%In your final cycle of awareness,~
#








%you function not as a being with purpose, but as a vessel for the cold, unfeeling darkness.~
#










%Each kill, each death, and every moment in this endless cycle has rendered you ever more vacant—~
#











%a shell echoing in the endless corridors.~
#












%The last remnants of who you were have dissolved into oblivion, leaving you a mere puppet,~
#













%adrift without thought, purpose, or hope.~
#














%In this state of absolute despair, you have become the embodiment of the catacombs' curse,~
#















%a silent witness to your own inevitable undoing.~
