%<The Dissonant Drift>~
#


%In the labyrinth, reality blurs into a continuous loop of meaningless repetition.~
#



%Each kill and each death pass by in a numbing haze.~
#




%Shattered fragments of memory float by—faces, corridors,~
#





%and symbols that once signified purpose now merge into a cacophony of meaningless whispers.~
#






%You move mechanically through the twists and turns,~
#







%trapped in a perpetual drift between what remains and what has faded entirely.~
#









%There's no clarity here; only discordant traces that hint at something lost—~
#










%a struggle you no longer recall fighting.~
