%<The Puppet's Lament>~
#


%Deeper into the maze, you exist almost as an automaton, disassociated from the weight of existence.~
#



%The hints of lineage and purpose that might have driven you are now silent relics,~
#




%buried beneath layers of overwhelming despair.~
#






%Every confrontation, every scattered score,~
#







%slips by without stirring any spark of identity or recollection.~
#








%You are a puppet dangling on frayed strings, moved by unseen forces and the relentless grind of fate.~
#










%There is a fleeting moment of internal rebellion, a murmur of resistance—~
#











%but it is quickly smothered by the void, leaving only the mechanistic rhythm of survival.~
