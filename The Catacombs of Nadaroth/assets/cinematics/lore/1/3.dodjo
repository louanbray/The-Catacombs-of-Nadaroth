%<The Unmoored Echo>~
#


%As you advance, the few vestiges of awareness,~
#



%that might have connected you to a forgotten past have long since disintegrated.~
#




%Moments of recognition slip past unnoticed as you perform actions with the detachment of a hollow shell.~
#





%The labyrinth's murmurs echo around you, but they no longer spark reasoning or resolve—~
#






%instead, they meld into a relentless, numbing dirge.~
#








%Your movements become reflexive, guided solely by instinct, devoid of any conscious thought.~
#









%The past, the rebellion, the defiant legacy—you feel nothing of it now,~
#










%only the echo of what once might have been a voice within.~
