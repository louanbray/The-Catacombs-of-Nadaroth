%<Faded Echoes>~
#


%As you traverse the labyrinth and accumulate score before each inevitable death,~
#



%elusive images and sounds return—but they come dimly.~
#




%You catch glimpses of corridors awash in muted, unreal colors, brief encounters with strange,~
#





%familiar threats, and the fleeting comfort of fleeting moments.~
#






%These fragments, however, are now tinged with doubt and half-remembered emotion.~
#








%You sense that every confrontation, every narrow escape, offers a hint of who you once were—~
#









%but the connections remain fragmented, and the logical ties have begun to unravel.~
