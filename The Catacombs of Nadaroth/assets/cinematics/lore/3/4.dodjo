%<Fragmented Recollection>~
#


%As the score climbs and death becomes a reluctant teacher,~
#



%the veil lifts further—but not without cost.~
#




%The labyrinth whispers of ancient rebellions and a defiant soul intertwined with its creation.~
#





%Vague revelations hint that you are no ordinary wanderer,~
#






%but a part of a force that once challenged the very fabric of these winding halls.~
#








%Yet,~
#









%with every new memory,~
#










%a significant piece of the puzzle seems to dissolve into the shadows.~
#











%The core of your being is revealed through sporadic flashes—a name,~
#












%a legacy—but the reasons for your presence within these cursed corridors remain maddeningly out of reach,~
#













%blunted by the erosion of reason.~
