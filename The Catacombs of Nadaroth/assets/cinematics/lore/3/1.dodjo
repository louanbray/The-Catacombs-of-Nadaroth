%<The Dim Awakening>~
#


%You awaken once again in the spawn chamber, the chill of the stone floor seeping into your bones.~
#



%The darkness remains oppressive, and the familiar uncertainty lingers.~
#




%Although your wounds ache and your mind remains unsteady, you begin to murmur half-forgotten questions.~
#





%The sensation is disorienting—your memories are present but diffuse, like scattered sparks in a fog.~
#







%"Who am I?" The question echoes feebly in the stillness,~
#








%a ghost of what once was, as you stumble into your next step without clarity.~
