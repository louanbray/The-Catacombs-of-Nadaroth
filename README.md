# The Catacombs of Nadaroth
_(School Project)_

A terminal-based adventure where you awaken as a lost adventurer in the twisting, haunted labyrinth of Nadaroth. Here, every step, every death, and every fragment of memory brings you closer to uncovering—or succumbing to—the dark legacy that binds you to these ancient catacombs.


## Story

You awaken in the dark, damp corridors of the catacombs with no memory of who you are or how you got there. As you navigate through the labyrinthine passages, you will encounter enigmatic puzzles, strange entities, formidable bosses, and valuable equipment that will aid you in your quest to escape. (WIP)

  Your progress is measured not just by physical survival, but also by a unique score that reflects both your achievements and your eroding mental health. With each death, you awaken anew in the spawn room, your mind further fragmented by despair. The narrative evolves depending on your mental health—ranging from clarity and determination to utter desolation.
